"""An app's self-description: the OpenAPI 3.1 document for its HTTP API, built from its Flask routes.

A workspace app that has an HTTP API serves this document at the path its
manifest names in ``api_schema_path`` (``/api/schema`` by convention), so an
agent reaching the app, from inside the workspace or over the share, learns
what the API offers without reading the app's code. The document is built from
the Flask url map on every request: each rule except Flask's static routes (the
app's and a blueprint's) and the schema route itself is a path, each method an
operation whose summary is the first paragraph of the view's docstring (as one
line) and whose description is the whole of it, and each path parameter a
required string parameter.

The app's route table says what each operation exchanges: a ``RouteModels``
entry names the pydantic models a route validates its JSON body with and
answers, which the document publishes as its request and response schemas, and
a ``SchemalessRoute`` entry says why a route carries no JSON (a page, a file, a
stream, a socket). The table is kept on the app, and ``app_schema.routes``
checks every parse and every answer against it at request time, so the
document cannot drift from what the routes do.
