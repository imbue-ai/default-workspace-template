"""How a route reads its JSON body and answers JSON, checked against the app's route table.

``parse_request_body`` validates the body with the model the table names for
the route and ``model_response`` answers the model the table names, so the
OpenAPI document and the running routes cannot disagree: a route that parses
or answers something the table does not say fails its first request with
``RouteModelsMismatchError``, a programming error, not a 400; so does a
modelled route that answers JSON around ``model_response`` or succeeds without
reading its body through ``parse_request_body``, which the check the app runs
on every answer catches. An ``ErrorResponse`` is allowed on every route, since
every operation's default response is one.
