# Extract the PTY sign-in machinery out of claude/auth.py

`harnesses/pty_auth.py` now owns the parts of a PTY-driven sign-in that are not
claude-specific: spawning a CLI on a pseudo-terminal at a pinned geometry, terminating and
closing it without letting teardown errors escape, replaying the raw stream through a
terminal emulator to recover a value the renderer width-wrapped, reading a value out of an
OSC 8 hyperlink target, and draining the stream until a caller's predicate is satisfied or
the output goes quiet.

`claude/auth.py` keeps everything that is actually about claude -- its regexes, the
settings-env credential writes, `.claude.json` approval recording, the agent-restart
cluster, and the two compositions (`_extract_oauth_url`, `_extract_setup_token`) that bind
claude's patterns to the generic extractors. It is 169 lines shorter and imports the rest.

Three details worth knowing, because the next harness will meet them:

- The frame marker and the PTY geometry are now parameters with claude's value as the
  default. The marker is Ink's synchronized-update sequence; a CLI that emits none is not
  broken, but its replay collapses to a single final-screen snapshot and loses the
  longest-wins protection against a truncated mid-frame candidate.
- `spawn_pty` accepts `env` and `cwd`. `pexpect.spawn` *replaces* the child environment
  rather than merging into it, so a caller scoping a sign-in to one config dir must pass a
  full environment or the child loses `PATH` and never starts.
- `ClaudeAuthError` now subclasses `PtyAuthError`, so the endpoint handlers that catch a
  single type keep working as more harnesses join.

No behaviour change and no user-visible change: same flows, same regexes, same timeouts,
same expect-list ordering.
